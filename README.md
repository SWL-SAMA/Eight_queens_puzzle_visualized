## About this program
This project is my final assignment for the course "Artificial Intelligence Technology" during my junior year(2022) at Nankai University.It is used to visualize the result and process of "Eight Queens Puzzle". The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. I programmed this to find all of the solution of this puzzle, and I also expand this to "N Queesn Puzzle Solution" which could arrange n queens to a chessboard.
